"""
Testing conventions:

Molecule variable names are the same as the molecule's molecular formula and are written with no special characters:
    ex:
        - H2
        - CH4
        - H2O

Atom variable names are the element symbol with an underscore and a running index to identify
    ex:
        - H_1
        - H_2
        - H_3
        - C_1
        - H_4
